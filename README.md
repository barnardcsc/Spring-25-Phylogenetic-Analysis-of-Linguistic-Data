# Spring-25-Phylogenetic-Analysis-of-Linguistic-Data

This workshop is taught by Ward Wheeler (Curator, AMNH Science Computing Facility; Professor, Richard Gilder Graduate School). 

The presentation will discuss aspects of phylogenetic analysis and how it is applied to linguistic data including the algorithms used to create, optimize, and search for phylogenetic graphs. The use case will be Indo-European languages. The visualization tool (compatible with MacOS devices only) allows users to explore alternate hypotheses of linguistic evolution and their impact on comparative optimality scores. No prior coding knowledge needed.
